## Future Plans
There are lots of future plans for QuizMaster. Tkinter eliminates a lot of possible features for this program and thats why I have many plans in the future just for formatting.

Before we get to the list, one major change that **will** be coming is more subjects. You might have noticed that this program's title is "QuizMaster: AP CSA Edition". But I plan on changing that to just "QuizMaster".

Here's a few more great changes to look forward to:
* Flask to add formattng changes with HTML5 and CSS3.
* Creating a webapp and hosting it online.
* Levels to each subject.
* Multiple types of answers (2 or more answers, 1 answer, etc.).
* Maybe move on to a mobile app someday.
* Intigrate with AI for comprehensive learning.
